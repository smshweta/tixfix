## Description 🎧

I have created this application as a part of an assignment for one of the companies. In this application, I have focused on the following aspects:

* User Friendliness
* Data Consistency
* Basic Security

## If this was a production application 🤔

1. I would have used `websockets` instead of `APIs` for real-time updation.
2. I would have implemented a better logging system, making debugging easy for developers.
3. Currently I am only generating  `ACCESS_TOKEN` for user authentication but would have generated
   `REFRESH_TOKEN` to provide a more secure and seamless user-friendly experience.
4. As of now I haven't given much thought to user scalability. More than `100` users might require more considerations at the API and DB design level, especially, get all APIs and database indexes.
5. Configured a more strict type-checking, and not using unknown datatype, which could be a cause of bigger problems.
6. Wrote unit and end-to-end tests.
7. Provide a more secure way to log in. Currently, exposes passwords in login API payload.
8. Error handling could be done better. Currently, in a short time, focused on covering happy cases, but did miss some edge cases.
9. Better UI Design.
